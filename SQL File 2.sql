/*A view is a database object that has no values. It is a virtual table that contains a subset of data within a table. 
It looks like an actual table containing rows and columns, but it takes less space because it is not present physically. 
It is operated similarly to the base table but does not contain any data of its own. Its name is always unique. 
A view can have data from one or more tables. If any changes occur in the underlying table, the same changes reflected in the views also.*/

Create View `View1` as Select * from customers;
Select * from View1;
Drop View IF exists View1;
